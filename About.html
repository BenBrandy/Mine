    <p>
        I am currently 25 years old who was born in Kisumu county in the year 1997. Grew up in a family of 5; 2 sisters and my prents.
        My interest for computers and electronics started when 
        I first had a handset mobile phone. When I joined campus, I even interacted more with computers and wanted to dig deeper. I have always had an undying passion for tech and what tech can do.
